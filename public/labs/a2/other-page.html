      A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or
      images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment,
      vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The
      technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices).
      In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written
      compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A
      single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
